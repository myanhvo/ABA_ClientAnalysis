# American Bar Association Client Analysis

## Description

Identify trends and assess customer satisfaction in the legal services industry through ABA's raw data. The research explores customer demographics, question categories, sentiment analysis of conversations, and the determinants of commonly asked questions. Machine learning techniques, such as elastic net, random forests, and neural networks, are employed to develop a robust classification model that predicts the most popular question categories based on relevant predictor variables.

## Features

- Analyze customer demographics to gain insights into the target audience.
- Categorize questions based on predetermined categories.
- Conduct sentiment analysis on customer conversations to gauge overall satisfaction.
- Identify the determinants and factors contributing to commonly asked questions.
- Develop a classification model to predict popular question categories.

## Data

The project utilizes raw data provided by the ABA, which includes customer information, conversation transcripts, and associated metadata. The data will be preprocessed and transformed to make it suitable for analysis and modeling purposes.

## Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing: Clean the raw data, handle missing values, and perform necessary transformations.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Conduct in-depth analysis of customer demographics, question categories, and sentiment analysis.
3. Feature Engineering: Identify relevant predictor variables and engineer additional features if necessary.
4. Model Development: Employ machine learning techniques, including elastic net, random forests, and neural networks, to develop a robust classification model.
5. Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the classification model using appropriate evaluation metrics.
6. Interpretation and Insights: Derive actionable insights from the model results and provide recommendations based on the analysis.
